\section{Opportunities for the Development of Vocational Teacher Competences}
  
As describe in the strategic objectives, Metropolia UAS offers opportunities for my development of vocational teacher competences. 
I am part of a new module for the second year students where we try to tightly integrate the competences of different teachers. 
We will teach the students how to build a web application user interface which deals with data management and the necessary plumbing to connect the two.
In parallel, a mathematics teacher will give them the underlying theory associated with data management such as set theory and statistics.
The idea is that the students create such application in a project based approach and we support them with theory and practice.
In this case, the challenges are in project-based learning, collaborative transformation of shared-object and co-teaching.

Another foreseen challenge will be designing the curricula for the third year students.
This process will start this fall 2015 and continue during next spring. 
It will be discussed later in August, so I do not know yet how much I could be involved in this task. 
It could be anyways a good opportunity for me to learn how to create new curriculum.
