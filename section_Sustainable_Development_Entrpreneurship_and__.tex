\section{Sustainable Development, Entrpreneurship and Multiculturalism}

Metropolia UAS has a long tradition of in multiculturalism With its international degree program, participation in Erasmus student and teacher exchange, work placement aboard and several international research and development projects\footnote{\url{http://www.metropolia.fi/en/about-us/international-metropolia}}. 
One key is the long tradition of providing full curricula in English, for example in the bachelor of engineering\footnote{\url{http://www.metropolia.fi/en/apply/studies-bachelor-technology/information-technology/}}, which attract many foreign students.
In ten years, I had students form all over the world: Europe (east and west), Americas (USA, Canada, Peru), Africa (Etiopia, Rwanda, Cameroon,\ldots) and Asia (China, Japan, Corea, Vietnam, India, Nepal, Pakistan,\ldots).
I also participated and still participate in many EU projects with partners institutions in Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Bulgaria, Sweden,\ldots
